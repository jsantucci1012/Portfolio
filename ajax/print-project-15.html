      <p>During my senior year in college, I took a class on the <em>Current Topics in Marketing</em>. Our professor had the class work with different businesses to gain real work experience and knowledge; my team chose to work with the Easter Seals in Joliet.</p>

      <p>After meeting with the organization's director, we collected desired data for Easter Seals and presented our finding to their board. In addition to collecting data, we also created a proposal for the board to create a <em>Young Professionals Advisory Board</em>.</p>

      <p>When creating our proposal, I took the initiative and created the brochure the board memebers could use to recruit new members to the advisory board.</p>
